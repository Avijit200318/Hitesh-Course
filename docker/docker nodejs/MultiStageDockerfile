this is an example how multistage docker file works

---- this is stage1 ----

FROM node:22-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .

---- this is stage2 ----

FROM node:22-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app /app
EXPOSE 3000
ENV PORT=3000
CMD ['npm', 'run', 'start']
